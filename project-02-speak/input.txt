Hi let me tell you the story about the man with a magical map on his hand.
He is now my boss and captain and is a well known figure in our land.
Before he was a boss he was a simple person.
He looks old now but was much younger.
He went on an adventure on the ocean and met a magical being.
The magical being said it would grant him a wish but it would come at a price.
The price wasn't dollars though, it was whatever was most valuable to him.
Being poor, he believed he had no value to lose so he wished to have a magical map.
The map would let him know of any enemies near and the path to any treasure.
But when he came back his sister and mom disappeared.
Years later he became one of the most known pirate in the world.
He even met a woman that turned out to be a queen and she kicked his ass once.
Eventually they became friends when he helped her with the Great War.
I am telling you this to warn you about making wishes when you travel the ocean.
Never make a wish with a being you see for it may have consequences and have you punished.
He's okay with it now, but that wish cost him more than anything money can buy.
I myself don't think I could live with that guilt.
